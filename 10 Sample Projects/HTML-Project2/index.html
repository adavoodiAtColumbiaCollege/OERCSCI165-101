      <h1 class="site_title">22 Essential Apps I Use Daily — 2022</h1>
      <h1 class="site_subtitle">Zartre - Jul 27</h1>
      <p>I have never shared my suite of essential apps before, so here it is. As I have multiple devices running different 
        operating systems(Android, iOS, macOS, Windows), I give a first priority to apps with cross-platform support.</p>
      <!--tag h1 for title--><!--set id for css code-->
      <h1 id="nt">Note taking</h1>
      <img src="./assets/photo1.png"/>
      <!--use p tag to create box & style for b tag and q tag-->
      <p><span class="app_name">Google Keep:</span> For quick notes, shopping lists for the day, and short notes I want to keep handy. It employs 
      Material You design which looks nice on my Pixel 5. My notes are synchronised and accessible on all my 
      devices.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">xNotability:</span> For written notes, scribbles, language learning, meeting notes. My notes are backed up to Google 
      Drive.The only downside is that the app is available only on iOS and macOS.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">Notion:</span> For serious notes, travel plans, wikis, learning, notes that need text formatting. Notion is very powerful 
      at being a database and creating interactive notes. I can also collaborate with friends when planning a trip.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">Standard Notes:</span> For plain text notes. I like the simplicity and the sense of privacy and security that Standard 
      Notes offers. Notes are encrypted end-to-end and you can also lock the app with different passcodes on each 
      device. More features can be added (on paid plans) through extensions.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">xTickTick:</span> For to-do lists. I can organise tasks into lists, assign a priority, repeat occurrences, add tags, add 
      subtasks, and do habit checks. The app is simple, lightweight, and works fast on all my devices.</p>

      <h1 id="co">Communication</h1>
      <img src="./assets/photo2.png"/>
      <p><span class="app_name">Edison Mail:</span> An email client on my iPad. I just like the design.</p>

      <p><span class="app_name">Gmail:</span> It comes with my phone and it works well so I don’t want to download anything else and keep two 
      email apps on my phone.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">LINE:</span> For messaging family and high school friends. I don’t really want to use it because the app is big and 
      bloated, but it has been well embodied in Thai culture since many businesses and government services offer 
      their communication and membership channels there.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">Slack:</span> My company uses this.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">Telegram:</span> For messaging friends. I can tell you this is the BEST messaging app. It is lightweight and crazy fast 
      on all my devices. It has creative and useful features I and my friends actually use and love. The app is simple 
      and interactions feel natural.</p>

      <h1 id="wb">Web browsing</h1>
      <img src="./assets/photo3.png"/>
      <p><span class="app_name">DuckDuckGo Browser:</span> I don’t want to be tracked. The good things are random private emails and tracking 
      prevention. The downside as of this writing is that the desktop version doesn’t support extensions so I have to 
      manually open 1Password, search for credentials and click autofill. Having no extensions means I have to 
      organise my bookmarks manually too (with Raindrop).</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">Raindrop.io:</span> For saving links. I can organise my links with tags and folders.</p>


      <h1 id="sec">Security</h1>
      <img src="./assets/photo4.png"/>
      <p><span class="app_name">1Password:</span> For storing and generating credentials. The user interface is clean and feels welcoming. It can store 
      OTP’s and automatically fill them (but I don’t use that feature). It can check if your passwords have appeared in 
      breaches, or are reused on multiple services. It can store many kinds of credentials other than passwords: SSH 
      keys, notes, identities, etc. Browser extensions work quite fast too.</p>
      
      <p><span class="app_name">Aegis:</span> For storing OTP’s. It is simple, fast and lightweight. I can backup the vault—encrypted—so I don’t have 
      to reconfigure 2FA on all services when I change my phone. I wanted to use 1Password for storing OTP’s 
      because it would automatically fill them, but what’s the purpose of two-factor authentication, then?</p>



      <h1 id="oa">Other Apps</h1>
      <div id="oa_div">
      <ol id="oa_list">
        <li id="oa_item">Google Home: This app combines devices from all platforms into one hub. Devices set up by other family members can be 
          controlled here and I don’t have to install their respective apps. Some controls might be limited but if I really want to control 
          the devices with more features, I can choose to install those separate apps.</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Mi Home: I personally prefer to use Xiaomi ecosystem in my bedroom because I can choose every single appliance solely on 
            my own. Xiaomi makes a great load of affordable products so it’s easy to find new appliances that are compatible in the 
            ecosystem.</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Tapo: For controlling lights in the common area of the house.</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Duolingo: Ich studiere jeden Tag Deutsch, 还是中文. (I have already completed the Chinese course, though.)</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Google News: I like how multiple news stories are grouped into a single coverage so I can read about the same event from 
            different sources and easily follow the event while it’s developing.</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Google Photos: For backing up photos from my phone and sharing photos with others.</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Toshl: For expense tracking and budgeting. The app is simple, lightweight and fast. The web version offers more detailed too.</li>
          <li id="oa_item">Zepp Life: For health tracking. I use my Mi Band 6 to track steps, sleep, exercises and to remind me when I have been sitting for 
            too long. I also pair the app with Mi Smart Scale to track my body composition like muscle mass, bone mass, water, protein, etc.</li>
