  <h2 style="color: #c4998a; margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">1.Main</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 24px;"><b>John Connor</b> the son of <b>Sarah Connor</b> and <b>Kyle Reese</b>, is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance, as well as the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines. Skynet, the 
    supercomputer mainframe of the machines, decides that John Connor is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition. After repeated failures at terminating John during 
    the war, Skynet decides to use a time displacement device to send Terminators to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war even begins.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #c4998a; margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">2.Original timeline</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 24px;">On the brink of extinction, John Connor united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps and overcome the Terminator guards. Much of the Resistance was created from these 
    survivors.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 24px;">John Connor led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the year 2029. In order to eliminate John Connor, Skynet sent a T-800 and a T-1000 to the past to kill John's mother, 
    Sarah, and young John Connor respectively via Time Displacement Equipment. Thus, John sends Kyle Reese, a young soldier, and a reprogrammed Series 800 Terminator to the past to protect Sarah 
    Connor and young John Connor respectively.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #c4998a; margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">3.Alternate timeline</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 24px;">John Connor was born to Sarah Connor on February 28, 1985. His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months prior in May 1984, protecting Sarah from a time-traveling Terminator. John's early life was 
    filled with training by various persons his mother Sarah had met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the Terminator. Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry, 
    computer technology, and espionage.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 24px;">When Sarah Connor was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early 1990s, John was placed into foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely 
    delusions. He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and rebelled, edging towards delinquency, turning into a young gangster and receiving a police record (which included trespassing, shoplifting, 
    disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was 10 years old. His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with him, and were not surprised when a police officer 
    showed up at their door asking to speak with John.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #c4998a; margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">4.Deviating timelines</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 10vw; margin-right: 10vw; font-family: 'Roboto Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 24px;">Because Sarah, John, and the T-800 successfully destroyed the laboratory of Cyberdyne Systems, Skynet is never created and Judgment Day never occurs. In the year 2027, John Connor is a U.S. Senator 
    and has a child.</p>
