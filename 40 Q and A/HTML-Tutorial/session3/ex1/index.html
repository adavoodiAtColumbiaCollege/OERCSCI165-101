      <p>Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that focuses on search engine technology, online advertising, cloud 
        computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and consumer electronics. It has been referred to 
        as the "most powerful company in the world" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, 
        and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology 
        companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
        Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. 
        Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The 
        company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet 
        Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was 
        appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also 
        became the CEO of Alphabet.
        The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant 
        market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (<a href="">Gmail</a>), navigation (<a href="">Maps</a>), cloud computing (Cloud), 
        web browsing (<a href="">Chrome</a>), video sharing (<a href="">YouTube</a>), productivity (<a href="">Workspace</a>), operating systems (<a href="">Android</a>), cloud storage (<a href="">Drive</a>), language 
        translation (<a href="">Translate</a>), photo storage (<a href="">Photo</a>), video calling (<a href="">Meet</a>), smart home (<a href="">Nest</a>), smartphones (<a href="">Pixel</a>), wearable technology (<a href="">Fitbit</a>), 
        gaming (<a href="">Stadia</a>), music streaming (<a href="">YouTube Music</a>), video on demand (<a href="">TV</a>), artificial intelligence (<a href="">Assistant</a>), machine learning APIs 
        (<a href="">TensorFlow</a>), AI chips (<a href="">TPU</a>), and more. Discontinued Google products include Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and 
        Inbox by Gmail.</p>

      <h1 id="photo2" id="ls">Larry & Sergey</h1>
      <h2>google founder</h2>
      <p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University
        in California. The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the
        code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a
        career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.
        While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about
        a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites. They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance
        by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began
        writing the code to implement Page's ideas.</p>
      <div id="divq"><q>Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance 
        of a site. Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani 
        and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of 
        the Google search engine, published in 1998. Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project. 
        PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, 
        with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine 
        Baidu.</q></div>

      <p>Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators. 
        According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, 
        with a market share of 65.6%. In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their 
        Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.
        Google launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites. Google 
        also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book 
        where allowed.</p>

      <h1 id="hg">History of Google</h1>
      <img id="photo4" src="./assets/photo4.png"/>
      <p>Google was officially launched in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to market Google Search, which has become the most used web-
        based search engine. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University in California, developed a search algorithm at first known 
        as "BackRub" in 1996, with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg. The search engine soon proved successful and the expanding 
        company moved several times, finally settling at Mountain View in 2003. This marked a phase of rapid growth, with the company making its 
        initial public offering in 2004 and quickly becoming one of the world's largest media companies. The company launched Google News in 
        2002, Gmail in 2004, Google Maps in 2005, Google Chrome in 2008, and the social network known as Google+ in 2011 (which was shut 
        down in April 2019), in addition to many other products. In 2015, Google became the main subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet Inc.
        The search engine went through many updates in attempts to eradicate search engine optimization
        Google has engaged in partnerships with NASA, AOL, Sun Microsystems, News Corporation, Sky UK, and others. The company set up a 
        charitable offshoot, Google.org, in 2005.</p>
