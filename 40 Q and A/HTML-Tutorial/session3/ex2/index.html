    <p><b>Abstract</b><i><u> art </u></i>uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_language">visual language</a> of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_art">Western art</a> had been, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_language">Renaissance </a>up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective</a> and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of<i><u> art </u></i>which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western <i>culture </i>at that time.</p>

    <p><b>Abstract</b> art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.</p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>ion indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. <b>Abstract</b>ion exists along a continuum. Even<i><u> art </u></i>that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be <b>Abstract</b>, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially <b>Abstract</b>. Total <b>Abstract</b>ion bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric <b>Abstract</b>ion, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative<i><u> art </u></i>and total <b>Abstract</b>ion are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic)<i><u> art </u></i>often contain partial <b>Abstract</b>ion.</p>

      <h1 id="his">History</h1>
      <p>Much of the<i><u> art </u></i>of earlier <i>cultures</i> – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose.[5] It is at this level of visual meaning that <b>Abstract</b><i><u> art </u></i>communicates.[6] One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.</p>

    <h2 id="ch">Classical antiquity</h2>
    <p>Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.[12][13] Three<i><u> art </u></i>movements which contributed to the development of <b>Abstract</b><i><u> art </u></i>were Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the plein air painting of the Barbizon school.</p>
    <p>Early intimations of a new<i><u> art </u></i>had been made by James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket, (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects. Even earlier than that, with her 'spirit' drawings, Georgiana Houghton's choice to work with <b>Abstract</b> shapes correlate with the unnatural nature of her subject, in a time when <b>Abstract</b>ion” isn't yet a concept (she organized an exhibit in 1871).</p>

    <!--style for q tag-->
    <p>In Chinese painting, <b>Abstract</b>ion can be traced to the Tang dynasty painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.[8] While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings. The Chan buddhist painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink" in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened.<q>A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to Tiantai buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese Zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by Sesshu Toyo in his later years.</q></p>
