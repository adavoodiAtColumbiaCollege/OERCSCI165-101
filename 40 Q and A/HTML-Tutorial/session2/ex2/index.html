    Animation Studios and released by <b>Walt Disney</b> Pictures. Directed by <b>Andrew Stanton</b> with co-direction 
    by <b>Lee Unkrich</b>, the screenplay was written by <b>Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds</b> from a story

    and <a href="">Geoffrey Rush</a>. It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin who, along with a regal 
    blue tang named Dory, searches for his missing son Nemo. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and 
    comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself. Released on May 30, 2003, Finding Nemo received 
    widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the visual elements, screenplay and characters that has

  <p><b>Finding Nemo</b> is the <a href="">best-selling DVD</a> title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006, and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before 
    Pixar's own Toy Story 3 overtook it. The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the American film Institute named it as the <a href="">10th greatest American</a> 
    animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists. A sequel, Finding Dory, was released in June 2016.ome time later, Marlin is overprotective of Nemo, born with a 
    stunted right fin. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin embarrasses Nemo, and the two argue. While Marlin is talking to Nemo's teacher, Nemo defiantly 
    approaches a nearby speedboat, where a pair of scuba divers capture him. Marlin pursues the boat in vain and meets Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term 
    memory loss, who offers her help. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin discovers a 
    diver's mask that fell from the boat; he accidentally hits Dory with it, giving her a nosebleed. The scent sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, but they flee after 
    accidentally setting off a ring of old naval mines, which knock Marlin and Dory unconscious. Nemo is placed in an aquarium in the office of dentist Philip 
    Sherman in Sydney, Australia. He meets the "Tank Gang", including yellow tang Bubbles, starfish Peach, cleaner shrimp Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma 
    Gurgle, and twin damselfish Deb and Flo, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. Nemo learns he is to be given to Sherman's young niece, Darla, who has killed her previous 
    fish.Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing Sherman to put the fish into 
    plastic bags while he cleans the tank, allowing them to roll out the window and into the harbor.</p>

  <p style="width: 800px; margin-top: 15vh;">The inspiration for <b>Finding Nemo</b> sprang from multiple experiences, going back 
    to director <b>Andrew Stanton's</b> childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see 
    the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. 
    In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags 
    Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after 
    seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could 
    be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a 
    walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an 
    opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.</p>
