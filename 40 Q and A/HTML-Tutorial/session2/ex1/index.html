  <p><b>Woody</b> is the same pull-string cowboy sheriff that Andy fell in love with years ago. But despite the fact that he’s found a new home with Bonnie and her toys, Woody is quietly struggling. For a toy who’s been with one kid year after year, change can be complicated. “It’s a whole new dynamic, which was really interesting to me. Bonnie plays differently with her toys than Andy did, and she has other toys who know her better. So, I knew that Woody wasn’t going to be her favorite” says director Josh Cooley.</p>

  <q>Ya know, you've handled this lost toy life better than I could.</q><br>
  <q>You can't teach this old toy new tricks.</q><br>
  <q>Because it's all I have left to do!... I don't have anything else...</q><br>

  <h2 id="buzz">BuzzLightyear</h2>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear"><img src="./assets/buzz.png"></a>
  <p><b>Buzz Lightyear</b> is loyal not only to his owner, but to the friends he’s made along the way—especially his once-rival Woody who’s like a brother to the ace Space Ranger these days. Buzz would do anything to support his pull-string buddy, but when his efforts land him in a carnival game booth as an inadvertent prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance.</p>
  <q>This is an intergalactic emergency.</q><br>
  <q>Do you know these life forms?</q><br>
  <q>My eyeballs could have been sucked from their sockets!</q>

  <h2 id="bopeep">BoPeep</h2>  
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Peep_(Toy_Story)"><img src="./assets/bopeep.png"></a>
  <p><b>Bo Peep</b> is a long-lost friend of Woody, Buzz and the gang, who always shared a special connection with Woody while residing with her sheep on a lamp base at Andy’s house. We also know that Bo Peep and Woody have some type of relationship, and we get to see them finally explore it in Toy Story 4.</p>
  <q>Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. Sometimes change can be good!</q><br>
  <q>So, How About You, How's Your New Kid?</q>
